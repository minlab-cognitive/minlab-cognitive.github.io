    <meta name="description" content="Summary:
We introduced a rank-1 neural circuit model to account for diverse types of integration kernels in click-version perceptual decision making task. Equipped with data-driven optimization pipeline, the rank-1 model fits human behavior well, in a way comparable to the state-of-art divisive normalization models and leaky competitive accumulators. Furthermore, the rank-1 network gain insights at both colelctive and single neuron levels. At collective level, we propose alternative hypothesis of neural mechanisms underlying diverse types of integration kernels through collective dynamics compared with divisive models. At single neuron level, the rank-1 network exhibited heterogenous single neuron response kernels, resembling the diversity observed in neurophysical recordings, which can be explained by the combination of behavior and input kernels.
