    <meta name="description" content="Summary:
Our research explores the neural mechanisms behind context-dependent decision-making (CDM) in humans and animals, focusing on discriminating between two selection mechanisms: input modulation and selection vector modulation. Using low-rank neural network modeling, we discovered that while input modulation is achievable with rank-one networks, additional dimensions are necessary for selection vector modulation. Through detailed information flow analysis, we revealed how these dimensions facilitate this modulation and identified new neural dynamical signatures at both neuron and population levels. Our findings offer a theoretical framework linking network connectivity and neural dynamics, advancing the understanding of circuit mechanisms in context-dependent computation.
